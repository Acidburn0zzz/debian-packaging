Init script is poorly written and adds an extra install dependency
Working directory is /usr/bin instead of /var/lib/gitea
  Templates are not found
  Most default paths are wrong
  Current hack includes --config in the init script
Not tested with systemD
Init needs to capture stdout/stderr and write to file
New golang-code.gitea-git-dev dependency requires downgrade
  Will require a clunky version number
Need to configure better logging options in default config
Doesn't seem to be building with sqlite3 support

v1.1.2 impacted by console logging bug:
  https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/602

Need to remove public/vendor/, whenever it exists:
