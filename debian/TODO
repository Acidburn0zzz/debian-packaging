- Pending upstream PR:
  + https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/1484
- Package remaining javascript libraries
- Need to rewrite/improve d/gitea.init
- Working directory is /usr/bin instead of /var/lib/gitea
  + Templates are not found
  + Most default paths are wrong
  + Current hack includes --config in the init script
- Not tested with systemD
- Init needs to capture stdout/stderr and write to file
